<h1>The Best Movies According to Taylor</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>The first film in the greatest adventure to ever have been written 
by the father of fantasy.<br />
No other movie gives me such a feeling of 
warmth and peace.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>The sequel to my favorite movie, though still just a part of one 
large story, which was<br />
one large book. The Fellowship is broken, but the 
journey continues.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>The epic conclusion to the greatest story ever told. Who you thought was the protagonist<br /> 
succumbs to darkness in the end, but the true hero reveals himself. The King reclaims his<br />
throne and the enemy is defeated.</p>
